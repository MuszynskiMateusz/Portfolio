# My First Ever Portfolio Website
-	üë§ When I started my journey with coding, I wanted to create my first portfolio website. This is how it turned out.
- ‚ùóÔ∏èTHIS WEBSITE WAS CREATED A LONG TIME AGO AND IS ONLY HERE TO SHOW ME HOW MUCH PROGRESS I HAVE MADE. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE IT AS MY ACTUAL PORTFOLIO. I AM CURRENTLY WORKING ON A NEW ONE.
